## Welcome to my website!

This is a space for me to showcase a little bit of what I've done and the skills I've picked up over the last couple of years.

I love learning new skills and practicing them. This site is also an experimentation zone for me to learn front-end-related programming.

I'm passionate about using technology to help others. Feel free to check out my portfolio or some of my writing and enjoy your stay!
