Here is a sample of some of the work that I've done.

## Analytics for WooliesX with Twitter

For a business strategy/data analytics case competition, I developed a set of tools to read in Twitter data and extract trends. This involved NLP, API work, transformer neural networks and a fair amount of pandas/matplotlib to derive value from data.

Also includes statistical NLP techniques, sentiment prediction, twitter bot detection, string distance, ngram analysis... the whole nine yards!

## Sydney Trains Game Solver

Have you ever been on a train in Sydney and looked at the carriage code? It usually looks like "5331". When you're bored, you can try to use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to get it to ten. I formalised the ruleset and created a website which plays the game! You may need to wake up the website if you're the first user in a while.

## Web App for Codenames

## Machine Learning - Coursework

In a team of four, we created a report detailing a variety of machine learning techniques to approach a text classification problem.

I used a variant of BERT - distilRoBERTa - to embed and classify instances. An inverse-frequency weighted training algorithm was also used to improve f-score as the dataset was highly unbalanced.
