Here is a sample of some of the work that I've done.

## Analytics for WooliesX with Twitter

For a business strategy/data analytics case competition, I developed a set of tools to read in Twitter data and extract trends. This involved NLP, API work, transformer neural networks and a fair amount of pandas/matplotlib to derive value from data.

Also includes statistical NLP techniques, sentiment prediction, twitter bot detection, string distance, ngram analysis... the whole nine yards!

## Machine Learning - Coursework

In a team of four, we created a report detailing a variety of machine learning techniques to approach a text classification problem.

I used a variant of BERT - distilRoBERTa - to embed and classify instances. An inverse-frequency weighted training algorithm was also used to improve f-score as the dataset was highly unbalanced.
